        <h1 class="center">About Sustainable Living</h1>
        <p>Sustainable living is a lifestyle that aims to reduce an individual's or society's use of the Earth's natural
            resources and personal resources. It is about making choices that are environmentally friendly, socially
            responsible, and economically viable.</p>
        <p> There are endless ways to live sustainably, including: reducing your use of resources, composting, relying on
      clean energy sources, reducing your consumption of single-use plastic, eating less animal products, shopping for
      clothing and other items sustainably, buying local, and more.</p>

    <div id="difference" class="box">
        <h1 class="center">Difference between Sustainable Living and Green Living</h1>
        <p>Sustainable living is a broader concept that encompasses green living. While green living focuses on reducing
            environmental impact through eco-friendly practices, sustainable living also considers social and economic
            factors to ensure a balanced approach to resource use.</p>
